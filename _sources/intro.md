# Intro

This is a brief workshop made for my lab. It doesn't explain fully all of the concepts it discusses, and isn't
intended to be a standalone book, but I do attempt to link out to relevant resources when needed.

**Update: 23-06-26 -** Updated to include some examples from miniscope lab on [Modularity](modularity/miniscope_io_refactoring) and [Writing Testable Code](tests/testable_code). The whole book remains an incomplete and disorganized resource, but it will likely be where I put different lessons on basic code structure for the time being :)

## Outline:

- **[Packaging](packaging)** -- Write code in a structured way
- **[Modularity](modularity/index)** -- Write code that can do more than one thing
- **[Docs](docs)** -- Write code that can be understood
- **[Tests](tests/index)** -- Write code you can trust
- **[Collaboration](collaboration)** -- Write code with others

Molly has graciously allowed us to use the prey capture analysis repository as an example: https://github.com/wehr-lab/Prey_Capture_Python
